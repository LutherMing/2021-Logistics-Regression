Assignment: Logistic Regression

## Numpy Version

Assignment Requirements:
Implement a Logistic Regression class using numpy and train it using gradient descent.

Include the following methods in the class:
1. `loss = fit(X, Y)`: This method is used for training. Inputs are `X`, a training dataset of size N * d where N is the number of samples and d is the dimension of the data, and `Y`, the true class labels of size N * 1. Output is `loss`, a list containing the value of the loss function for each iteration.

2. `y_pred, y_pred_label = predict(X)`: This method is used for testing. Input is `X`, a test dataset of size N * d where N is the number of test samples. Outputs are `y_pred` of size N * 1, containing the model's predicted values, and `y_pred_label` of size N * 1, containing the predicted class labels based on the predicted values.

Please implement these methods in a well-structured manner within the Logistic Regression class.
